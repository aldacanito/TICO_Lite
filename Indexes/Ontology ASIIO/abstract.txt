The Airport Security Interoperability Integrated Ontology (ASIIO) is an integrated ontology that combines cyber and physical security. 
Critical infrastructures, like airports and hospitals, provide essential services and are considered huge investments in any country. Ensuring the security of these critical infrastructures is a necessity in every possible aspect. These infrastructures, however, currently make use of different technological solutions with distinct security levels, features and knowledge representation formats which often do not communicate directly with each other, leaving the task of processing the global view of the institutionâ€™s security to the end-users. In order to have a complete view of the current cybersecurity status of a given system, interoperability between these tools must be addressed. Different ontologies have been proposed to deal with subdomains of cybersecurity. Similarly, these fail to provide a full view of cyber and physical security that would be necessary to achieve a global security approach.
