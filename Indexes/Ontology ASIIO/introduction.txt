The  Security  of  Air  Transport  Infrastructure  of  Europe (SATIE)  project  aims  to  develop  a cybersecurity  toolkit  to  face  cyber-physical  threats  in  airports  in  a  coordinated  and  effective way, supported by a shared situational awareness system.  
Several systems of varying responsibilities contribute to this result by cooperating and exchanging security data. These systems’ responsibilities include, but are not limited to:  
• Cyber threat detection;  
• Risk assessment; 
• Simulation of impact propagation; 
• Vulnerability management; 
• Crisis alerting.  
The  cyber  threat  detection,  air  traffic  monitoring  services,  passenger  data,  access  control, traffic  management,  and  baggage  handling  systems  all  work  as  data  sources,  providing  real-time  information  about  events  occurring  in  different  parts  of  the  airport.  To  achieve  the general  goal  of  securing  critical  infrastructures,  it  is  required  from  all  involved  systems  to communicate  with  each  other,  such  that  a  holistic  view  of  the  environment  is  possible.  
An  ontology  focused  on  cybersecurity  can  provide  a  standard  data-exchange  between  these systems,  which  would  not  only  facilitate  the  existing  communications  but  also  the  addition, removal,  or  compensation  of  systems  from  the  overall  architecture.  For  an  ontology  to  be 
useful in this scenario, it would have to cover the knowledge representation needs of all the concerned  parties,  provide  a  unique  frame  of  reference  over  the  meaning  of  the  exchanged messages which leaves no room for ambiguity, and guarantee that  the same conclusions can be  inferred  in  any  part of  the  system.  Such  a  semantic  layer  would  facilitate  a  holistic, integrated view of the security status of the airport at any given moment, and the collaboration  of  multiple  concerned  parties  would  lead  to  an  increase  in  the  quality  of  the resulted work.

The ASIIO ontology was developed in the scope of the Security of Air Transport Infrastructures of Europe SATIE project (Security of Air Transport Infrastructure of Europe, H2020 – GA nr. 832969).
